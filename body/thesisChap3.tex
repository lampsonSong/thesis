\chapter{Proposed Methodology}

Procrustes analysis, named after a bandit from Greek mythology who streches or cut off his victim to his bed, is used to analyse the distribution of a set of shapes. Shape is all geometrical information that remains when location, scale and rotational effects are filtered out from an object ~\cite{IMM2002-0403}. 

For ASM (Active Shape Model), the training data set contains arbitrary size images for the Procrustes analysis would normalize the data.
