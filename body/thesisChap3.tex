\chapter{Proposed Methodology}

Procrustes analysis, named after a bandit from Greek mythology who streches or cut off his victim to his bed, is used to analyse the distribution of a set of shapes. Shape is all geometrical information that remains when location, scale and rotational effects are filtered out from an object ~\cite{IMM2002-0403}. 

For ASM (Active Shape Model), the training data set contains arbitrary size images for the Procrustes analysis would normalize the data.

\section{Background Knowledge}
AAM (Active Appearance Model)


\section{Method}

They proposed a linear mapping that is intuitive given the nature of the vectors that span shape and appearance space of AAM. Each component of a shape vector is an offset of the mean shape, the same as appearance. Also the vector itself represents the overall displacement that gives rise to a specific type of gesture (Add a picture? ). One vector might be responsible for opening and closing the mouth, while another might control eye blink, and so on. ~\cite{Theobald07}

However, it is far more complex in real situations. Multiple vectors control the eye blink. The correspondence between models are different.
