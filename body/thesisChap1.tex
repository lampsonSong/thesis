The practical situations are eager to find a way to protect human identity privacy. Mosaic and blur.

Mehrabian illustrates that the spoken words of a message contributes only for $7\%$ to the effect of the message as a whole, the voice intonation contributes for $38\%$, while the facial expression of the speaker contributes for $55\%$ to the effect of the spoken message ~\cite{Meh68}
