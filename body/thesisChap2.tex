\section{Ad-hoc methods}
	Simple distortion methods are applied to the image privacy protection field such as pixelation and blurring. The pixelation method subsamples the image and the blurring method smoothes images with some filters like Gaussian filter or average filter ~\cite{Agrawal09,Boyle00}. Both by destorying the original image information, pixelation and blurring make a trade between privacy information and image quality. ~\cite{Winkler14}
