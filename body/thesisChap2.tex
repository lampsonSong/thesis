\section{Ad-hoc methods}
	Simple distortion methods are applied to the image privacy protection field such as pixelation and blurring. The pixelation method subsamples the image and the blurring method smoothes images with some filters like Gaussian filter or average filter ~\cite{Agrawal09,Boyle00}. Both by destorying the original image information, pixelation and blurring make a trade between privacy information and image quality. Although these two methods are widely used in practical situations like TV interviews, they suffer from the same risk proposed in ~\cite{Newton05} called parrot attack which applies face recognition algorithms to pixelated or blurred images so that target images and database images are preprocessed with the similar procedures. 

	Two more de-identificaiton methods are introduced in ~\cite{Winkler14}: blanking and encryption.
