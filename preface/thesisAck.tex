This project would not have been completed without the support of many people. I highly appreciate my supervisor, Hui Zhang, who enlightened me from knowing nothing in this field and helped me make sense of my confusion. Thanks to my principle supervisor, Pong-Chi Yuen, who offered guidance and support during the period of study. Thanks to Hong Kong Baptist University for providing me a monthly studentship for my study. And finally, thanks to my parents and numerous friends who always offering support and love.
